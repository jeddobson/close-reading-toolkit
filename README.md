LaTeX Source for Close Reading Toolkit Chart

This repository contains the LaTeX source to build a PDF of the Close Reading Toolkit, a tool for teaching close reading of literary texts to students.

This chart was initially developed by Jed Dobson for the American Renaissance MOOC that he taught with Donald E. Pease for DartmouthX on the edX platform in the Winter of 2016.

The Close Reading Toolkit is released here under the MIT License.
